# Agile development

Right from the beginning, we are going to take an *agile* approach to development.

What this means in practice is:

* Story-based project planning
* Behaviour-driven development
* Paired programming
* A product owner
* Two-day sprints
* Daily scrums
* Sprint planning
* Sprint review and retrospective 
* Timeboxing (see Pomodoro)
* Stop, go, continue
